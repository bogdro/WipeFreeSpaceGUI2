========================= Running

Requirements:
- WipeFreeSpace
- JRE, the Java Runtime Environment >= (1.)7.0

Using Apache NetBeans: open the WipeFreeSpaceGUI2 directory as a
 NetBeans Project and click "Run" (or press F6).

By hand (after unpacking):
	double-click the WipeFreeSpaceGUI2\dist\WipeFreeSpaceGUI2.jar
	file (works on MS Windows)
		or
	run.bat	(on MS Windows)
		or
	run.sh	(on Un*x)
		or
	java -jar WipeFreeSpaceGUI2/dist/WipeFreeSpaceGUI2.jar	(on Un*x)
		or
	java -jar WipeFreeSpaceGUI2\dist\WipeFreeSpaceGUI2.jar	(on MS Windows)

Read the "INSTALL" file.

========================= Running in the default language (no translations)

Requirements:
- WipeFreeSpace
- JRE, the Java Runtime Environment >= (1.)7.0

Using Apache NetBeans: open the WipeFreeSpaceGUI2 directory as a NetBeans
 Project, right-click the project's root element in the project's tree on the
 left side of the window (the "Projects" sub-window), then click "Properties".
 Click "Run" in the tree and put
	-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US
 in the "VM Options" field. Click OK and click "Run" (or press F6).

By hand (after unpacking):
	run-en.bat	(on MS Windows)
		or
	run-en.sh	(on Un*x)
		or	(on Un*x)
	java -jar -Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US WipeFreeSpaceGUI2/dist/WipeFreeSpaceGUI2.jar
		or	(on MS Windows)
	java -jar -Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US WipeFreeSpaceGUI2\dist\WipeFreeSpaceGUI2.jar

Read the "INSTALL" file.

========================= Compiling (if necessary)

Requirements for compiling:

- JDK, the Java Development Kit >= (1.)7.0

Compiling using Apache NetBeans: open the WipeFreeSpaceGUI2 directory as a
 NetBeans Project, right-click the project's root element in the project's
 tree on the left side of the window (the "Projects" sub-window),
 then click "Build".

Compiling using "ant" from NetBeans (you may need to provide the full
 path to "ant"):

	cd WipeFreeSpaceGUI2-X.Y
	ant jar

Compiling by hand :
	- on Un*x shells try:
		cd WipeFreeSpaceGUI2/src/BogDroSoft/wfsgui/
		javac *.java
	- on MS Windows this could work:
		cd WipeFreeSpaceGUI2\src\BogDroSoft\wfsgui
		javac *.java

========================= Usage (GUI)

Use the checkboxes to select the options to pass to WipeFreeSpace.
Use the "Add filesystem(s)..." and "Remove filesystem(s)" buttons to manage
 the list of filesystems to wipe.
Press the "Start" button to start wiping. The "Stop" button can be used to
 stop wiping, but it stops the WipeFreeSpace program in a way that prevents it
 from closing the filesystem properly, so damage can occur. Use only when
 really necessary.

========================= Usage (command line)

The following command-line (case-insensitive) options are supported:

	--all-zeros		- wipe only using zeros
	-b|--superblock <off>	- superblock offset on the given filesystems
	-B|--blocksize <size>	- block size on the given filesystems
	--conf <file>		- read configuration from the given file
	-f|--force		- continue even if the filesystem has errors
	--help			- display help
	--lang LL_CC_VV		- select the language to use by
					WipeFreeSpaceGUI2: "LL" is the
					language, "CC" is the country code,
					"VV" is the variant. Separate them
					using underscores. Only LL is needed.
	--last-zero		- additional wiping with zeros
	--licence, --license	- display license information
	--method <name>		- use the given method for wiping (read below)
	-n|--iterations <n>	- number of iterations (wiping passes)
	--nopart		- do NOT wipe partially used blocks
	--nounrm		- do NOT wipe undelete data
	--nowfs			- do NOT wipe unused space
	--use-ioctl		- disable cache during work (can be DANGEROUS)
	--no-wipe-zero-blocks	- do NOT wipe all-zero blocks
	--use-dedicated		- use the program dedicated for the given
					filesystem type
	--version, -V		- display program version

WipeFreeSpaceGUI2 passes the wiping method's name directly to WipeFreeSpace.
 You can choose one of the predefined methods (requires WipeFreeSpace >= 1.5)
 or enter your own, if your version of WipeFreeSpace supports other methods.
The following method names (case-insensitive) are available in
 WipeFreeSpace version 1.5:
- Gutmann (method similar to Gutmann's, the default, 36 passes)
- random (shred-like, 25 passes)
- schneier (Schneier's method, 7 passes, contains ITSG-06)
- dod (DoD, 3 passes, contains NAVSO P-5239-26 and German Federal
   Office for Information Security)

========================= Translating

To translate the program to your language, make a copy of each *.properties
 file in the src/BogDroSoft/wfsgui/i18n/ directory. Rename these files so
 they end with your language and country code, for example:
	WfsMainWindow_en_GB.properties
	AboutBox_de_DE.properties
	CommandLineParser_pt_BR.properties
Then open each file in UTF-8 mode and translate the words AFTER the "=" in
 lines containing user messages. When you've finished all the files, send
 them to me. Remember: UTF-8, not ISO-8859-X, not windows-XXXX/cp-XXXX.
NOTE: If you change the words before the "=", your translations won't
 be seen by the program.

NOTE: Alternatively, use can use the Apache NetBeans IDE to translate.
 Just open the WipeFreeSpaceGUI2 project, right-click any of the main
 properties' file, choose "Add" and "Locale". Choose your language and
 select OK. Now right-click the chosen file and select "Open". Edit the
 strings in your language.

========================= Reporting problems

Any defects, issues or improvement suggestions can be reported by e-mail
(you can find it at the top of this file) or in the SourceForge project
defect manager at https://sourceforge.net/p/wipefreespace/bugs/.

1. Check if you have the newest versions of WipeFreeSpaceGUI2.
2. Include precise steps for reproducing the error, if possible. This will
   make finding the problem easier.
3. If the program crashed, include "wfsgui2.log" in your report. It should be
   in the current WipeFreeSpaceGUI2 working directory or the temporary files'
   directory or the user's home directory.
4. If the program exited normally, but the "wfsgui2.log" still exists after
   closing the program and is not empty, include it in your report.
5. Take all the information from the above steps and any additional
   information you can give and include it in your report.
